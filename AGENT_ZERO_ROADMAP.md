# Agent Zero Integration Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision
Transform the professional DXF generation system into an AI-agent-friendly service that allows Agent Zero to convert natural language kitchen descriptions into precise CAD drawings.

## 🏗️ Current State Assessment
- ✅ **Professional DXF Engine**: 19 entity types, comprehensive validation, production-ready
- ✅ **Enterprise Architecture**: Factory patterns, error handling, processing summaries  
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage and API documentation
- ❌ **Agent Zero Integration**: No natural language interface or semantic translation layer

## 📋 Phase 1: Semantic Translation Layer (Week 1)
**Goal**: Enable Agent Zero to describe kitchens in natural language

### 1.1 Semantic API Endpoint
- Create `/semantic` endpoint for natural language input
- Accept descriptions like "Modern L-shaped kitchen with island, 4x3 meters"
- Parse key attributes: layout, style, dimensions, appliances

### 1.2 Kitchen Vocabulary Engine
- Build mapping from descriptive terms to technical parameters
- Support layout types: L-shaped, galley, U-shaped, open-plan, compact
- Support styles: modern, traditional, industrial, farmhouse, minimalist
- Support appliances: refrigerator, stove, sink, dishwasher, island, peninsula

### 1.3 Coordinate Generation Logic  
- Convert room dimensions to proper coordinate systems
- Auto-calculate optimal appliance placement based on ergonomics
- Generate workflow-optimized kitchen triangle placement

**Deliverables**:
- `semantic_parser.py` - Natural language processor
- `kitchen_vocabulary.json` - Term-to-parameter mappings
- Updated API with `/semantic` endpoint

## 📋 Phase 2: Kitchen Template Engine (Week 2)
**Goal**: Provide pre-built, parameterizable kitchen archetypes

### 2.1 Template Definition System
- Extract 5 proven kitchen layouts from existing examples
- Create parameterized template structure with variable dimensions
- Support style modifiers and appliance variations

### 2.2 Template Selection Logic
- Smart template recommendation based on space constraints
- Automatic template scaling for different room sizes
- Conflict resolution for impossible combinations

### 2.3 Template Library
```json
{
  "templates": {
    "l_shaped_with_island": {
      "min_dimensions": [3000, 2500],
      "optimal_dimensions": [4000, 3000], 
      "appliances": ["required", "optional"],
      "style_variations": ["modern", "traditional"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Deliverables**:
- `kitchen_templates.json` - Complete template library
- `template_engine.py` - Template selection and parameterization
- Updated `/semantic` endpoint with template integration

## 📋 Phase 3: Agent Zero Integration Kit (Week 3) 
**Goal**: Provide complete integration resources for Agent Zero

### 3.1 Agent Zero Prompt Library
- Pre-written prompt templates for common kitchen scenarios
- Decision trees for template and style selection
- Error handling and recovery strategies
- Example conversations and expected outputs

### 3.2 Integration Documentation
- Complete Agent Zero setup guide
- API usage examples with natural language inputs
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Performance optimization recommendations

### 3.3 Conversation Flow Design
- Define multi-turn conversation patterns
- Handle iterative design refinements
- Support "what-if" scenario exploration

**Deliverables**:
- `AGENT_ZERO_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete integration guide
- `agent_zero_prompts.md` - Ready-to-use prompt library
- `conversation_examples.md` - Sample Agent Zero interactions

## 📋 Phase 4: Smart Defaults System (Week 4)
**Goal**: Ensure robust generation even with incomplete information

### 4.1 Intelligent Gap Filling
- Auto-calculate missing dimensions based on space constraints
- Apply building code compliance automatically
- Generate proper technical annotations and dimensions

### 4.2 Error Prevention System
- Validate spatial relationships (appliances don't overlap)
- Ensure accessibility compliance (door swing clearances)
- Apply kitchen workflow best practices automatically

### 4.3 Quality Assurance Engine
- Verify generated layouts meet industry standards
- Check for common design mistakes
- Provide improvement suggestions

**Deliverables**:
- `smart_defaults.py` - Intelligent gap-filling system
- `validation_engine.py` - Quality assurance checks
- Enhanced error reporting with suggestions

## 📋 Phase 5: Conversational API (Week 5)
**Goal**: Enable iterative design refinement through conversation

### 5.1 Session Management
- Stateful design sessions with conversation history
- Change tracking and version management
- Ability to rollback to previous design states

### 5.2 Modification API
```python
# Conversation flow
POST /design/start       # "Create a modern kitchen"
POST /design/{id}/modify # "Add an island in the center"  
POST /design/{id}/refine # "Move the sink to the island"
POST /design/{id}/export # "Generate the final DXF"
```

### 5.3 Interactive Design Features
- Real-time design validation during conversation
- Visual feedback for Agent Zero (ASCII layout previews)
- Contextual suggestions based on current design state

**Deliverables**:
- `conversation_api.py` - Stateful design session management
- `design_session.py` - Session state and modification tracking
- `interactive_feedback.py` - Real-time validation and suggestions

## 🧹 Project Cleanup Plan

### Files to Remove (Completed Roadmap Artifacts)
- ❌ `roadmap.md` - Old 5-step plan (completed)
- ❌ `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Celebration document (no longer needed)
- ❌ `DXF_CAPABILITIES.md` - Redundant with CLAUDE.md
- ❌ `README.md` - Basic starter template (superseded)
- ❌ `test_step1.py` through `test_step5_simple.py` - Step validation tests (completed)

### Files to Update
- 🔄 `CLAUDE.md` - Add Agent Zero integration context
- 🔄 `test_comprehensive.py` - Update for Agent Zero integration scenarios  
- 🔄 `KITCHEN_EXAMPLES.md` - Condense to 3-5 key Agent Zero examples
- 🔄 `openapi.yaml` - Add semantic API endpoints

### Files to Keep (Essential Core)
- ✅ `src/main.py` - Professional DXF generation engine (no changes needed)
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
